// 1. Implement a traffic light using an abstract class and an enum in Java. The traffic
//    light should have three states: RED, YELLOW, and GREEN, and it should
//    transition between these states automatically every few seconds. The abstract
//    class should define a method called changeState() that the enum can use to
//    transition to the next state

//       Main main = new Main();
//       main.changeState();


// 2. Create an enum called "CoffeeSize" that contains values for small, medium, and
//    large coffee sizes. Write a program that prints the name and ordinal value of each size
//

//        CoffeeSizes cs = CoffeeSizes.SMALL;
//        cs.chooseSizeOfCoffee();


// 3. Create an enum called "Planet" that contains values for the planets in the
//    Solar System. Each planet should have a name, a mass, and a distance
//    from the Sun. Write a program that prints the name and mass of each planet.

//        SolarSystem ss = SolarSystem.EARTH;
//        ss.listOfPlanets();


// 4. Create an enum called "DayOfWeek" that contains values for the days of
//    the week. Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a day of
//    the week, and then prints whether that day is a weekday or a weekend day.


//        DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = DayOfWeek.MONDAY;
//        dayOfWeek.whichIsDay();


// 5. Create an enum called "Season" that contains values for the four seasons
//    (e.g. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). Each season should have an
//    associated temperature range. Write a program that prompts the user to
//    enter a temperature, and then prints the name of the season that corresponds to that temperature.

//        Seasons seasons = Seasons.AUTUMN;
//        seasons.findSeason();


// 6. Create an enum called "Topping" that contains values for various pizza
//    toppings (e.g. pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, sausage, etc.). Create a
//    second enum called "PizzaSize" that contains values for various pizza
//    sizes (e.g. small, medium, large). Write a program that prompts the user
//    to choose a pizza size and a number of toppings, and then calculates the
//    price of the pizza based on the size and number of toppings.

//        PizzaSize pizzaSize = PizzaSize.SMALL;
//        pizzaSize.pizzaSize();
    }
